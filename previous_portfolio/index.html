                                  <p>My main focus was improving student retention: After a year and half of researching and iterations; I improved student retention by 25% by empowering support managers with an at-risk students identification dashboard, using an explainable, statistical model based on core retention and learning metrics.</p>
                                  <p>In order to tackle business objectives around team efficiency, I helped increase our teams’ daily efficiency by training models and delivering real-time student insights to focus on students who needed the most help. </p>
                                  <p>I had the opportunity to present analyses results to non-technical teams, report and present weekly data findings to C-level executives, shaping the company's data strategy. The strategic thinking included using data to plan Coding Dojo’s adaptive learning strategy based on the LMS data, evaluating marketing channels and sales processes by analyzing their impact on student retention and revenue recognition, etc.</p>
                                  <p>Throughout my work at Coding Dojo, I learned how to manage a team (with one data engineer reporting to me) including regular reviews and goal definition, and I could research ways to improve the Learning Science capabilities & the student bootcamp experience, using for example clustering algorithms for customer segmentation; student survey iterations, A/B testing to improve student data collection; machine learning models with our LMS data: LSTMs, Random Forests... to advance the understanding of our student learning habits. </p>
